This repository is the [`traits.build`](https://github.com/traitecoevo/traits.build) user manual. It contains 

* in-depth details about the traits.build data standard, R package and workflow, 
* advice about best practices,
* tutorials.

The manual is implemented as a typical [`quarto book`](https://quarto.org/docs/books/) project with a single `_quarto.yml` file at the top level and one Quarto source file for each chapter. End users are encouraged to read the rendered output at <https://traitecoevo.github.io/traits.build-book/>.
