This repository is the [`traits.build`](https://github.com/ropensci/targets)
R package user manual. It contains in-depth discussion and walkthroughs
of the main features of [`traits.build`](https://github.com/ropensci/targets)
and advice about best practices. The goal is to introduce new users to
[`traits.build`](https://github.com/ropensci/targets) and instill a thorough
understanding of what it does, how it works, and when to use it. The
manual is implemented as a typical
[`bookdown`](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown) project with a single
`_bookdown.yml` file at the top level and one R Markdown source file for
each chapter. End users are encouraged to read the rendered output at
<https://books.ropensci.org/targets>.
